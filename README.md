# Hey Folks!
I'm neither a nerd nor a geek. I'm just a normal 15-year-old boy, working hard to become something in life. I'm also a blogger and a programmer, I know Python, Go, HTML, CSS and Javascript. I'm passionate about computer science. I'm just a normal boy, who loves to read books, write new things and code. I'm a not-so-social guy, but I love meeting new people. I'm optimistic and enthusiastic, but not a know-it-all. I am continuosly trying to create things. I have been a very curious person for as long as I can remember. If you have any question or suggestion, feel free to contact me.
